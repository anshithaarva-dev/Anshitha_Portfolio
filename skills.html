            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>

            <article id="python">
                <h4>Python</h4>
                <p>I know Python pretty well - it's actually my favorite language! I can write programs to analyze data,
                    make simple apps, and automate boring stuff. I've used libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and
                    scikit-learn for various data analysis projects. Still learning new things about it every day
                    though.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="html">
                <h4>HTML</h4>
                <p>I can make web pages using HTML. I know how to create headings, paragraphs, links, images, and
                    organize content into sections. I'm still learning but I can make basic websites that actually look
                    decent.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="css">
                <h4>CSS</h4>
                <p>I can style web pages with CSS - sometimes it drives me crazy with the positioning stuff, but I'm
                    getting better at it. I know how to change colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. I can make things
                    look nice and organized. Currently learning about flexbox and responsive design (grid is next on my
                    list!).</p>
            </article>

            <article id="javascript"> <!-- Fixed the ID naming - was inconsistent before -->
                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <p>I'm learning JavaScript to make websites interactive. I can add simple functions, handle user input,
                    and make basic animations. Still a beginner but getting more comfortable with it each day. The async
                    stuff still confuses me sometimes though.</p>

            <h3>Data Analysis Tools</h3>

            <article id="tableau">
                <h4>Tableau</h4>
                <p>I can use Tableau to make charts and dashboards - love how visual it is! I can connect to different
                    data sources, create various types of visualizations, and make interactive reports. I've used it for
                    several school projects and it always impresses people.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="excel">
                <h4>Excel</h4>
                <p>I'm pretty good at using Excel for data analysis. I can use formulas (VLOOKUP is my friend), pivot
                    tables, charts, and basic data cleaning. I use it all the time for organizing and analyzing data.
                    It's not the fanciest tool but it gets the job done.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="sql">
                <h4>SQL</h4>
                <p>I know basic SQL to work with databases. I can write simple queries to get data, filter results, and
                    join tables. Still learning more advanced SQL features - window functions are on my todo list!</p>

            <h3>Other Skills</h3>

            <article id="git"> <!-- Made ID consistent with lowercase -->
                <h4>Git & GitHub</h4>
                <p>I can use Git to save different versions of my code - lifesaver when things break! I know basic
                    commands like commit, push, pull, and merge. I use GitHub to share my projects and collaborate with
                    others. Still getting used to branching and merge conflicts though.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="problem-solving"> <!-- More descriptive ID -->
                <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
                <p>I really enjoy solving problems and figuring out how things work - it's like solving puzzles! I can
                    break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and find solutions step by step.
                    Sometimes I overthink things, but I usually get there in the end.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="communication"> <!-- Expanded the ID -->
                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>I can explain technical concepts in simple terms (my family is my test audience for this!). I can
                    write clear documentation and present my findings to others. I work well in teams and genuinely
                    enjoy helping others understand what I'm working on.</p>
