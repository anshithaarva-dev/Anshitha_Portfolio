            <h3>Data Analysis Projects</h3>
            
            <article id="iphone16">
                <h4>iPhone 16 Review Analysis</h4>
                <p>I analyzed YouTube comments about iPhone 16 Pro using Python. I used VADER sentiment analysis to see how people felt about the phone. I also used topic modeling and clustering to find out what people were talking about most. I made visualizations in Tableau to show the results.</p>

            <article id="tourism">
                <h4>Global Tourism Analysis</h4>
                <p>I worked with UN Tourism data to analyze global tourism trends. I cleaned the data using Python and made charts to show what I found. I also used time-series forecasting to predict how tourism would recover after the pandemic. I found that international travel was coming back and sustainable tourism was growing.</p>

            <article id="weather">
                <h4>Weather Data Analysis</h4>
                <p>I analyzed weather data from different cities to find patterns. I used Python pandas to clean the data and matplotlib to make graphs. I found that some cities have similar weather patterns and seasonal changes.</p>

            <h3>Web Development Projects</h3>
            
            <article id="FormSenseAi">
                <h4>FormSenseAI</h4>
                <p>This is an AI app that helps people exercise correctly. It uses a camera to watch how you move and tells you if you're doing the exercise right. I used TensorFlow.js for the AI part and made the website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also added user accounts and login system.</p>

            <article id="stocky">
                <h4>Stocky - Stock Market Simulator</h4>
                <p>This is a website where people can practice trading stocks without using real money. It uses real stock data and lets users create fake portfolios. I made the front end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back end uses Node.js and MongoDB to save user data.</p>

                <h4>Personal Portfolio Website</h4>
                <p>This website you're looking at right now! I made it using HTML and CSS. I learned how to make navigation menus, organize content into sections, and style everything to look nice. It was my first time making a complete website.</p>

            <article id="calculatorApp">
                <h4>Calculator App</h4>
                <p>I made a simple calculator using Python. It can do basic math like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I used tkinter to make a simple window with buttons. It was one of my first Python projects.</p>

            <article id="pass-gen">
                <h4>Password Generator</h4>
                <p>I created a program that generates random passwords. Users can choose how long they want the password to be and what characters to include (letters, numbers, symbols). I used Python's random module to make the passwords.</p>
