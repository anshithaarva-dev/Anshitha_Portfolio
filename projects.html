            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>Here's a collection of projects I've worked on - from data analysis to full-stack applications. 
               Always learning something new with each one!</p>

            <h3>Data Analysis & Visualization</h3>
            <article id="iphone16">
                <h4>iPhone 16 Review Analysis Based on YouTube Comments</h4>
                <p>Analyzed public reception of the iPhone 16 Pro by scraping and preprocessing YouTube comments using
                    Python. Applied VADER sentiment analysis to classify viewer sentiment and used topic modeling (LDA) and
                    clustering (Sentence-BERT) to identify key discussion themes. Visualized results with Tableau to uncover
                    consumer sentiment trends and product perception insights. Really interesting to see how people 
                    actually felt about the new features!</p>

            <article id="tourism">
                <h4>Global Tourism Analysis</h4>
                <p>Working with UN Tourism and the World Travel & Tourism Council datasets, I analyzed and explored
                    global tourism patterns. Used Python for data cleansing and visualization, and also forecasted
                    post-pandemic recovery trajectories using time-series forecasting models. Found some really
                    interesting trends like the recovery of international travel, growing interest in sustainable tourism, 
                    and how digitization is changing traveler behavior. Created interactive dashboards to present 
                    findings for strategic tourism industry planning.</p>

            <h3>Programming Applications</h3>
            <article id="RadiantYou">
                <h4>RadiantYou</h4>
                <p>Developed an AI-powered application that bridges the gap between customers and beauty brands by
                    offering a virtual makeup assistant. The app provides realistic makeup previews and personalized
                    product recommendations tailored to individual users. Built the backend using Python for data
                    processing and analysis, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creating an interactive frontend.
                    Focused on debugging, error handling, and code optimization to ensure reliable performance.
                    This was a fun project combining AI with beauty tech!

                <h4>Personal.Ai</h4>
                <p>
                    Designed and managed AI-driven projects to enhance creative writing, business automation, and
                    customer service workflows. Implemented ChatGPT integration and virtual assistants to improve 
                    operational efficiency and client interactions. Developed client-facing solutions that streamline
                    communication, automate repetitive tasks, and deliver actionable insights. Maintained detailed
                    project roadmaps and conducted regular progress reviews to ensure alignment with client requirements,
                    timelines, and measurable outcomes. AI is really changing how we approach workflow automation!

                <h4>Advanced Calculator Application</h4>
                <p>Planning to build a scientific calculator with graphing capabilities using JavaScript and Canvas API. 
                   Want to include features like equation solving, unit conversions, and maybe even some basic calculus 
                   functions. Still in the planning phase but excited about this one!</p>
