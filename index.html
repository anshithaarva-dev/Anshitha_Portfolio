                    provided datasets

                    post-pandemic recovery trajectories using time-series forecasting models. Recognized noteworthy
                    tendencies like
                    the comeback of international trips, mounting sustainable tourism, and the effect of digitization on
                    traveler's
                    behavioral shift. Leveraged interactive dashboards to share findings which facilitated the strategic
